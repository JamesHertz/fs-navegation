# FS-NAVEGATION
 I really like to use alias to move between my directory tree, but adding an alias isn't as comfortable as I wanted it to be. So I decided that would allow me to move between my directories fast and in a very confortable way. I also plan to add new functionatlities to what a simple alias can do.

# TASKS

# Reminders

The idea is to do two parts. A script part that will interact with the user and will query the other part for folder's name. The other part will be a program in C and will store the names and their related \<path\> in a txt file.
